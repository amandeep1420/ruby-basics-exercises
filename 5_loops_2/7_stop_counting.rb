# my answer:

5.times do |index|
  puts index
  break if index == 2
end 
  
# something is wrong with this problem...is this a trick or something?

# I was exactly right, but the wording of this problem/vagueness really irks me.

# no, no - I just didn't understand what the .times method does. It always counts from 0 to one less than the specified number.
# |index| was just a block parameter - though I don't recall having seen one being used with .times before for some reason...

# 'further exploration': 5, 1. Correct.
