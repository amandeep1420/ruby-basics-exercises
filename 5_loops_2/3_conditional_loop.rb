# my answer:

if process_the_loop = [true, false].sample == true
  puts "The loop was processed!"
else
  puts "The loop wasn't processed!"
end 

# oops - I didn't write a loop! This is a section about loops! Derp.

# try again.

# wait, this problem is so...unnecessary. it's a loop for the sake of a loop and it's way too verbose and I don't like it one bit.
# I get that this is a section about loops, but...dude...this is way too counter-intuitive.

# granted, my solution wasn't perfect - I should've just used the variable itself in the initial if statement - but it worked.

# the book acknowledges that this is silly, but the problem is that this didn't feel intuitive at all.

# blah.
