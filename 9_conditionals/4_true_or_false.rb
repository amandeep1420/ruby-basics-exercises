# my answer: 

boolean = [true, false].sample

boolean ? "I'm true" : "I'm false"

# I REMEMBERED WHAT A TERNARY OPERATOR WAS AND THE PROPER SYNTAX TO WRITE ONE!

# ...however, I didn't use a puts to actually print the results. Lol.

# see below - take special note of the need for parentheses:

boolean ? puts("I'm true!") : puts("I'm false!")
