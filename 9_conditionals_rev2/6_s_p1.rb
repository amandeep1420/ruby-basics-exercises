# my answer:

stoplight = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'].sample

case stoplight
  when 'green'
    puts 'Go!'
  when 'yellow'
    puts 'Slow down!'
  else
    puts 'Stop!'
end 

# holy wow, I got this right. granted, I did sub in when for if after checking the error from the IDE...but still, first try!
