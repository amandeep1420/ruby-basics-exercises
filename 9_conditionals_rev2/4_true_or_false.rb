# my answer:

boolean = [true, false].sample

puts boolean ? "I'm true!" : "I'm false!" 

# grr...remembered what ternary operators are, but forgot how to calls puts from within them so I prepended it...which worked, but doesn't match 
# the book solution.

# book solution below:

boolean ? puts("I'm true!") : puts("I'm false!")
