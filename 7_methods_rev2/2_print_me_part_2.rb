# my answer:

def print_me
  return "I'm printing the return value!" # only returns
end 

# or

def print_me2
  p "I'm printing the return value!"      # prints + returns
end 

# GAH. I forgot that the last line of a method is what's returned unless otherwise specified. I didn't need to write return.
