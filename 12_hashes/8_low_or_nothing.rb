# my answer:

numbers = {
  high:   100,
  medium: 50,
  low:    10
}

low_numbers = numbers.select! do |key, value|
                 value < 25
               end

p low_numbers
p numbers

# further explanation:
=begin 
In our solution, we assign the return value of #select! to low_numbers. Is this assignment really needed if we mutated numbers? 
Typically, when using methods that mutate the caller, the return value is of no interest because the caller is intentionally being mutated. 
If you do an assignment like this, you end up creating an alias: both numbers and low_numbers now point to the same Hash.
