# my answer: 7

# book answer: an error is thrown. a was never defined *within the scope of the method*. Pay attention, now.

# look hard at this problem vs. the others: b was always the parameter, and a was never used without assigning a value first.
# don't get sloppy.

# repeat after me: local variables are not available in the scope of a method definition.
