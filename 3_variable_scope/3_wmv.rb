# my answer: won't there be some kind of error since a is an undefined variable within the method definition..?

# answer: a is still 7. I got hung up on something unimportant. a is defined as equal to b..that was a useless train of thought and was incorrect.
# these questions are hammering home the fact that method definitions and local variables are completely independent from one another.
