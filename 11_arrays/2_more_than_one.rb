#***IMPORTANT TO REVIEW***

# my answer:

pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

my_pets = []

my_pets = pets[2], pets[3]

puts "I have a pet #{my_pets[0]} and a pet #{my_pets[1]}!"

# 100% correct, but they used a range to get both elements. They also didn't declare an empty array beforehand. See below:

my_pets = pets[2..3]

# you can use ranges of numbers to select multiple elements at the same time.

# good stuff.
