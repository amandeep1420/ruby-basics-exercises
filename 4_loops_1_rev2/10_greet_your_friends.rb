# my answer: 

friends = ['Sarah', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Dave']

friends.each { |friend| puts "Hello, #{friend}!" } 

# did your read the prompt? we're supposed to use a for loop.

# already saw a bit of the answer - see below:

for friend in friends                       # friend is just a placeholder variable here - you could write anything.
  puts "Hello, #{friend}!"
end
